# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 02, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Setup domain, hosting and a static page for my blog

**Thoughts:**  Really enjoyed the process got stuck a few times when trying to get the site to work on gitpages. Also went through a lot of issues with trying to get google analytics but got it in the end (hopefully).

### Day 2: May 03, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on LinkedLists using Nodes for my exam

**Thoughts:**  Found it hard to really get into it but got it done. Code isn't perfect but I feel I've a very good understanding of
linked lists now and how to create a Node and my own Linked List.

### Day 3: May 04, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Binary Trees using Comparable and Interfaces

**Thoughts:**  I know to to implement a Comparable object and to use generics but I'm not sure it'll cover my exam question. 
Need to practise more questions in the future to iron it out 100%.

### Day 4: May 05, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Exam was today! Worked on Breadth-first search

**Thoughts:**  Exam was tough enough. For sure need to work on comparable objects and generics still! Had a bit of fun playing around
with Breadth-first Search might make a little game.

**Link to work:** Link to be added have my code mixed in with exam code I don't want to upload yet

### Day 5: May 06, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Setting up a MicroService using spring boot

**Thoughts:**  I'm working long with a video tutorial with from [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8IQb4ofjDo&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZSKAFG6aCDVDP86Qx4lNas&index=1). Got through the first 20 short videos got another 4 to go then time to mess around with it
myself! Seems pretty simple. Tech: Spring Boot, Eureka.

### Day 6: May 07, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Trying to get heroku to work with the microservices

**Thoughts:**  Spent way too much time trying to figure out how to make these microservices to work through heroku and eureka. Completed the first part of the tutorial though and will start part 2 though. Can see the big gap in my knowledge.

### Day 7: May 08, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed part 2 of [JavaBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfsomLHaSzQ&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbXZY_elyGv7IkKrfkSrX5e&index=21) it is mostly about Hystrix

**Thoughts:**  Learned some really interesting information about circuit breaker patterns and how hystrix can be used as a "circuit breaker" with micro services. I'll complete the tutorial in the morning then study for my exams!

**Thoughts:**  Learned about bulkhead pattern seems very useful. Other three I'm learning how to implement are Observer, Factory and the Decorator pattern. They seem basic enough but will take practise to learn when to implement them.
