# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 02, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Setup domain, hosting and a static page for my blog

**Thoughts:**  Really enjoyed the process got stuck a few times when trying to get the site to work on gitpages. Also went through a lot of issues with trying to get google analytics but got it in the end (hopefully).

### Day 2: May 03, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on LinkedLists using Nodes for my exam

**Thoughts:**  Found it hard to really get into it but got it done. Code isn't perfect but I feel I've a very good understanding of
linked lists now and how to create a Node and my own Linked List.
