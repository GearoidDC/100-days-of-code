# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 02, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Setup domain, hosting and a static page for my blog

**Thoughts:**  Really enjoyed the process got stuck a few times when trying to get the site to work on gitpages. Also went through a lot of issues with trying to get google analytics but got it in the end (hopefully).

**Link to work:** [My Blog](https://www.teatimecode.com)
